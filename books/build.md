## 1.1 Adulthood

When you are looking at the array of potential careers before you, the correct place to start is "What do I want to
learn?"

- NOT: How much money do I want to make?
- NOT: What title do I want to have?
- NOT: What company has enough name recognition?

Early adulthood is about watching your dreams go up in flames and learning as much as you can from the ashes.

Go where you can grow - people, mission, the opportunity are all that matters.

> The only failure is your twenties is inaction. The rest is trial and error.

Humans learn through productive struggle, by trying it themselves and screwing up and doing it differently next time.
You have to push yourself to the mountain, even if it means you might fall of a cliff.

## 1.2 Get a job

If you are going to throw your time, energy, and youth at a company, try to join one that's not just making a better
mousetrap. Find a business that's starting a revolution:

- it's creating a product that's wholly new or combines existing technology in a novel way that the competition can't
  make or even understand
- this product solves a problem - a real pain point - that a lot of customers experience daily
- the novel technology can deliver on the company vision
- leadership is not dogmatic about what the solution looks like and is willing to adapt to their customers' needs
- it's thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you've never heard before, but makes a perfect sense once
  you hear it

Cool technology isn't enough, a great team isn't enough, plenty of funding isn't enough. You have to time you product
right. The world has to be ready to want it. If you're not solving a real problem, you can;t start a revolution.

Seemingly impossible problems that a decade ago would have cost billions to solve, requiring massive investments from
gian firms, can now be figured out with a smartphone app, a small sensor, and the internet.

If you are passionate about something - something that could be solving a huge problem one day - then stick with it.
Because one day, if you are truly solving a real issue, when the world is ready to want it, you will already be there.

You don't have to an executive right away, you don't have to get a job at the most amazing, world-changing company out
of college, but you should have a goal.

## 1.3 Heroes

The only thing that can make a job truly amazing or complete waste of time is the people.

You always have something to offer if you are curious and engaged. You can always trade and barter good ideas; you can
always be kind and find a way to help.

Try to get into a small company, the sweet spot is a business of 30-100 people building something worth building. You
could go to Google, Apple, Facebook, or some other giant company, but it will be hard to maneuver yourself to work
closely with the rock stars.

Smaller companies still have specialization, but usually without silos. And they have a different energy. The whole
company will be focused on working together to make one precious idea become reality. Anything unnecessary is shunned -
red tape and politics are typically nonexistent.

Being in that lifeboat with people you deeply respect is a joy. It is the best time you can have at work. It might be
the best time you can have.

## 1.4 Don't (only) look down

IC - individual contributor - a person who doesn't manage others. As an IC, you need to occasionally do 2 things:

- look up - look beyond the next deadline or project, bne sure the mission still makes sense to you and that the path to
  reach it seems achievable
- look around - get out of your comfort zone and away from the immediate team you are on,talk to the other functions in
  your company to understand their perspectives, needs, and concerns

Don't think doing the work just means locking yourself in a room - a huge part of it is walking with your team. The work
is reaching your destination together. Or finding a new destination and bringing your team with you.

## 2.1 Just managing

6 things you should know before becoming a manager:

- You don't have to be a manager to be successful - many people wrongly assume that the only path to more money and
  stature is managing a team. There are alternatives that will enable you to get a similar paycheck.
- Remember that once you become a manager, you will stop doing the thing that made you successful in the first place -
  your job will be communication, communication, communication, recruiting, hiring, firing, setting budgets, reviews,
  one-to-one meetings, setting goals, keeping people on track, resolving conflicts, mentoring, ...
- Becoming a manager is a discipline - management is a learned skill, not a talent.
- Being exacting and expecting great work is not micromanagement - your job is to make sure the team produces
  high-quality work, it only turns into micromanagement when you dictate the step-by-step process.
- Honesty is more important than style - you can be successful with any style as long as you never shy away from
  respectfully telling people the uncomfortable, hard truth needs to be said.
- Don't worry that your team will outshine you - in fact, it's your goal, you should always be training someone on your
  team to do your job, the better they are, the easier it is for you to move up and even start managing managers

When you are a manager, you are no longer just responsible for the work. You are responsible for human beings.

A star individual contributor is incredibly valuable. Valuable enough that many companies will pay them just as much as
they'd pay a manager. A truly great IC will be a leader in their chosen function and also become an informal cultural
leader, someone who people across the company will seek out for advice and mentorship.

Examining the product in detail and caring deeply about the quality of what your team is producing is not
micromanagement. That's exactly what you should be doing. Steve Jobs was bringing out a jeweler's loupe and looking at
individual pixels on a screen to make sure the user interface graphics were properly drawn.

As a manager, you should be focused on making sure the team is producing the best possible product.

It is very easy to turn 1:1s into a friendly chats that go nowhere, so clear meeting agenda can be beneficial.

If you are a manager - congrats, you're now a parent. Not because you should treat your employees like children, but
because it's now your responsibility to help them work through failure and find success.

## 2.2 Data versus opinion

Data driven decisions - you can acquire, study, and debate facts - relatively easy to make.

Opinion-driven - follow your gut and your vision - always hard and always questioned.

Make decisions, not everyone has to agree - it happens when one person has to make the final call. This isn't a
democracy, nor dictatorship - you can't give orders without explaining yourself.

Storytelling is how you get people to take a leap of faith to do something new. Creating a believable narrative that
everyone can latch on to is critical to moving forward and making hard choices. It's all that marketing comes down to.

You are selling - vision, guy, opinion.

> It's not data or intuition, it's data and intuition.

## 2.3 Assholes

Up to 12 percent of corporate senior leadership exhibit psychopathic traits. There are different assholes:

- Political assholes - people who master the art of corporate politics, but then do nothing but take credit for everyone
  else's work. These assholes usually build a coalition of budding assholes around them
- Controlling assholes - micromanagers who systematically strangle the creativity and juy out of their team. They never
  give people credit for their work, never praise it, and often steal it.
- Asshole assholes - they suck at work and everything else, mean jealous, insecure jerks. They cannot deliver, are
  deeply unproductive, so they do everything possible to deflect attention away from themselves. They are generally out
  of door pretty quickly.
- Mission-driven "assholes" - crazy passionate - they are neither easygoing nor easy to work with. Unlike true assholes,
  they care.

Pushing for greatness doesn't make you an asshole. Not tolerating mediocrity doesn't make you na asshole. You need to
understand their motivations.

Controlling assholes won't listen. They will never admit they screwed up.

Things you can do when faced with a controlling asshole:

- kill'em with kindness
- ignore them
- try to get around them
- quit

Most people aren't assholes. And even if they are, they are also human. So don't walk into a job trying to get anyone
fired. Start with kindness. Try to make peace. Assume the best.

## 2.4 I quit

Sometimes you need to quit. Here is how you know:

- You are no longer passionate about the mission - every hour at your desk feels like an eternity
- You have tried everything - the company is letting you down

Once you do decide to quit, make sure you leave in the right way - try to finish as much as possible, find natural
breakpoint in your project.

Hating your job is never worth whatever raise, title, or perks they throw at you to stay.

The threat of leaving may be enough to push your company to get serious and make whatever change you are asking for. But
it might not. Quitting should not be a negotiating tactic - it should be the very last card you play.

Good things take time, big times take longer. If you flit from project to project, company to company, you will never
have the vital experience of starting and finishing something meaningful.

## 3.1 Make the intangible tangible

Don't just make a prototype of your product and think you're done. Prototype as much of the full customer experience as
possible.

Your product isn't only your product. It's the whole user experience. The customer journey and touchpoints:

- awareness (PR, search, social media, ads)
- education (website, email, blog, trial/demo)
- acquisition (partners, payment model)
- product (design, UX, performance)
- onboarding (quick guide, account creation, tips, how-to videos)
- usage (reliability, usability, updates, lifespan)
- support (troubleshooting, knowledge base, call center, community)
- loyalty (new product, newsletter, promotions, ratings/reviews)

## 3.2 Why storytelling

Every product should have a story, a narrative that explains why it needs to exist and how will it solve your customer's
problems. A good product story:

- it appeals to people's rational and emotional sides
- it takes complicated concepts and makes them simple
- it reminds people of the problem that's being solved - it focuses on the why

The story of your product, your company, and your vision should drive everything you do.

Virus of a doubt: "it is a way to get into people's heads, remind them about a daily frustration, get them annoyed about
it all over again. You get them angry about how it works now so they can get excited abut a new way of doing things."

Product's story is its design, features, images, videos, quotes from customers, tips from reviewers. The sum of what
people see and feel about this thing that you have created.

Why does this thing need to exist? Why does it matter? Why will people need it? Why will they love it? The longer you
work on something, the more the "what" takes over the "why". When you get wrapped in the "what", you get ahead of
people. You think everyone can see what you see. But they don't.

Earn their trust by showing that you really know your stuff or understand their needs. Of offer them something useful,
connect with them in a new way, so they feel assured that they're making the right choice with your company.

Appeal to their emotions, connect with something they care about. Their worries, their fears. Every person is different,
and everyone will read your story differently.

Analogies can be a useful tool in storytelling. They create a shorthand for complicated concepts.

## 3.3 Evolution versus disruption versus execution

Evolution - a small, incremental step to make something better

Disruption - a fork on the evolutionary tree - something fundamentally new that changes the status quo, usually by
taking a novel or revolutionary approach to an old problem

Execution - doing what you have promised to do and doing it well

Your version one product should be disruptive, not evolutionary. But disruption alone will not guarantee success.
Continue to evolve, but always seek out new ways to disrupt yourself.

Disruption should be important for you personally. If you've truly made something disruptive, your competition probably
won't be able to replicate it quickly.

Just don't overshoot. Don't try to disrupt everything at once.

As your disruptive product, process, or business model begins to gain steam with customers, your competitors will start
to get worried. They'll start paying attention, they will get pissed. When companies get angry they undercut your
pricing, try to embarrass you with marketing, use negative press, put in new agreements with sales to lock you out of
the business.

And they might sue you. If they can't innovate, they litigate. The good news is that a lawsuit means you've officially
arrived (you are a real threat, and they know it).

Disruptions - extremely delicate balancing act:

- you focus on making one amazing thing but forget that it has to be part of a single, fluid experience
- beautiful execution on everything else but the one thing that would have differentiated your product withers away
- you change too many things too fast and regular people can't recognize or understand what you have made, you can't
  push people too far outside their mental model, not at first

Challenge yourself, over-deliver, create excellent solutions.

If you do it right, one disruption will fuel the next. One revolution will domino another.
